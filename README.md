It includes an id, name, author, publisher

This was challenging because I use a windows computer and the most
critical parts of the tutorial were for IOS systems specifically,
it gave me a whole bunch of errors and things that I had to look up to 
on the internet, spent a good amount of time trying to not only learn from
the tutorial but also figuring out windows way of doing it lol

Big thanks to Kevin Holt the guy sent the whole class a message with 
some of the solutions he found while also following the tutorial on
windows!
